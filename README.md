# Handover Calculations

The handover routine I have for my daughter is for us to have half the week in school termtime, and then half the school holidays each. 

* Christmas holidays we alternate mum/dad first. 
* Summer holidays are so long we have a fortnight each, then a week each, then split the rest.
* For all other holidays and half-terms I have the first half, with a handover at the midpoint. 

Although splitting holidays in half (based on midday handovers) seems a simple approach, there are many challenging elements.

When there are an odd number of nights in the holiday, how do you split them in half? There will then be two candidates for the handover day, and a way of deciding between them is required. Here are some options, and their problems.

* Alternating the odd night
  - Should it be based on the last 'gainer' of a night, or just alternate the gainer and loser regardless if it's an odd holiday with a night to be gained. If you only alternate the gaining holidays, it could be two or three even-nighted holidays in between, requiring meticulous records and agreements to be struck, remembered.
* Handover only on odd-numbered dates
  - Unfortunately there are occasions when the 31st and 1st are next to each other in the calendar
    
If there are two candidate days for a handover, a reasonably fair approach is to select the day earliest in alphabetical order. Then a Friday beats a Saturday, a Saturday beats a Sunday and so on. This has the benefit of needing no record or exhaustive agreement on past holidays to settle which day the handover takes place.
